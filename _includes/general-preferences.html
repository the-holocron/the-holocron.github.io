	<h2>General Preferences</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Don't try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.</li>
		<li>Well commented code is extremely important. Even if you think the code is self-describing, its often better to not leave others guessing as to the purpose of uncommon or non-obvious code.</li>
		<li>Take time to describe components, how they work, their limitations, and the way they are constructed.</li>
	</ul>
