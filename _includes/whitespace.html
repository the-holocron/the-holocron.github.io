	<h3>Whitespace</h3>
	<p>Only one style should exist across the entire source of your code base. Always be consistent in your use of whitespace as it helps improve readability.</p>
	<p><strong>Tip:</strong> configure your editor to "show invisibles". This will allow you to eliminate end of line whitespace, eliminate unintended blank line whitespace, and avoid polluting commits.</p>
